## Purpose
Predicting "House Loan Prices" using Turkish Websites and Google Maps.
In this project, I am looking for monthly housing loan prices in districts of Ankara such as Pursaklar, Çubuk, and Keçiören.
## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yavuzibr/house-rental-prices-in-districts-of-ankara
## ML Algorithm
Linear Regression -> Scikit-Learn
## Future Improvements
Ankara has 25 districts but in the dataset, I only used 3 districts. We can add all districts and divide them into regions for a better understanding of prices.
Also, in this dataset, we have data between December 2023 and January 2024. We can add more data about different months.
